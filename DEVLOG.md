# Development log

Key decisions, scope constraints, and architectural choices.

## 2026-07-08 — v3 strategic scope

**Positioning:** Browser-based platform for collecting, organizing, validating, and communicating traffic count data. Covers the workflow before and around technical analysis engines (Synchro, HCS), not inside them.

**Explicitly out of scope:**
- LOS / HCM analysis (Synchro, HCS, SIDRA own this)
- Signal timing optimization
- Traffic simulation
- Crash data analysis
- Speed measurement from automated equipment
- AI/automated counting (Miovision, Streetlight)
- Travel demand modeling

**Core market gap:** Replacing broken Excel-based workflows for count data organization, QA, warrant screening, and public communication. Not competing with validated engineering analysis tools.

## 2026-07-08 — UI architecture

**Decision:** Replace linear screen-stacking wizard with persistent sidebar + workspace model.

- Home screen = project portfolio (cards)
- Inside a project: left sidebar always visible with intersection list and study-level nav
- Intersection detail = tabs (Setup | Count | Analyze | Charts) in the right panel
- No more back buttons for navigation — sidebar handles all routing
- Desktop-first; mobile deliberately deferred

**Single intersection projects:** Same sidebar structure, one intersection in the list. Consistent UX across project types.

**Trip Gen:** Different sidebar (land uses, not intersections). Tabs: Setup | ITE rates | Distribution | Summary | Export. Distribution tab is new — allocates generated trips as percentages to nearby intersections. Optional link to an area study for before/build volume overlay.

## 2026-07-08 — Stage 1 scope

First deliverable milestone — makes the tool produce something a firm can hand to a client:

1. Turning movement diagram (SVG, auto-generated from TMC data)
2. Time-of-day volume chart (vehicles + peds by interval)
3. Mode split summary (vehicles vs. pedestrians %)
4. Print-ready count summary sheet

All built on existing data — no new collection types needed for Stage 1.

## 2026-07-08 — Stage 2 scope (planned)

1. AI-assisted CSV/XLSX import (Claude API for column mapping, confirmed by user before import runs)
2. Saved import templates (vendor format library)
3. Count QA/validation layer
4. Bicycle count type
5. Study metadata capture (weather, observer, equipment)

---

## 2026-07-08 — Stage 3 scope (planned)

1. Signal warrant analysis (MUTCD Warrants 1, 2, 3)
2. Before/after comparison mode
3. Corridor volume chart
4. Project portfolio persistence (IndexedDB or cloud)
5. Shareable public study page (view-only link)
